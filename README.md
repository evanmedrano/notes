## What this repository is about

I decided to create this repository to keep my personal coding notes all
in one place.

I will be combining both my own notes as well as the style principles
that I found helpful from
[https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style]

I do not own or take any credit for the style.md files within each
respective directory. They have been taken from thoughtbot's repository
and I thank them for making such a useful resource I can refer to.
