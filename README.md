## What this repository is about

I decided to create this repository to keep my personal coding notes all
in one place.

I will be combining my own notes as well as the [style principles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style) and
[best practices](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/best-practices) that I found helpful from [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/)

I do not own or take any credit for the style.md or best_practices.md files within each respective directory.
They have been taken from thoughtbot's repositories and I thank them for making such a useful resource I can refer to.

I also will have my notes from several different technical books. I do
not claim any of the words as my own, as most of the notes will be
either a direct or closely paraphased extraction from the book.
