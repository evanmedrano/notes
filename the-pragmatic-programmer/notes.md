The Pragmatic Programmer notes
==============================

Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy
----------------------------------
* Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done;
  explain what *can* be done to salvage the situation
* When you find yourself saying, "I don't know", be sure to follow it up
  with-"but I'll find out". A solid way to admit what you don't know,
but then take responsibility like a pro
* Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor
  code). Fix each one as soon as it's discovered. Take *some* action to
prevent further damage and to show that you're on top of the situation
* You can discipline yourself to write software that's good enough--good
  enough for your users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of
mind. You'll find that you are more productive and your users are
happier
* The phrase "good enough" does not imply sloppy or poorly produced
  code. All systems must meet their users' requirements to be
successful, and meet basic performance, privacy, and security standards
* Surprisingly, many users would rather use software with some rough
  edgers today than wait a year for the shiny, bells-and-whistles
version
* Great software today is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect
  software tomorrow. If you give your users something to play with
early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution
* Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial
  portfolio

  1. Serious investors invest regularly - as a habit
  2. Diversification is the key to long-term success
  3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and
     high-risk, high-reward investments
  4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return
  5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically

* To be successful in your career, you must invest in your knowledge
  portfolio using the same guidelines
* Goals for investing in your knowledge portfolio

  1. Learn at least one new language every year
  2. Read a technical book each month
  3. Read nontechnical books too
  4. Take classes
  5. Participate in local user groups and meetups
  6. Experiment with different environments
  7. Stay current

* The last important point is to think *critically* about what your read
  and hear. You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is
accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype
* Tips for communication

  1. Know what you want to say
  2. Know your audience
  3. Choose your moment
  4. Choose a style
  5. Make it look good
  6. Involve your audience
  7. Be a listener
  8. Get back to people
  9. Keep code and documentation together
