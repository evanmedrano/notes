This repo is a way for me to keep any notes that I take from my readings
in one place, as I won't always remember or have the book at my side.
You may find these notes useful too. All the notes I have taken are from
the book [Clean
Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert C. Martin

I don't claim any of the words as my own, as they are either taken
directly or closely paraphrased from the writings in the book. If you
want more detail on any of the notes, I would suggest buying the book.
It's a great read
